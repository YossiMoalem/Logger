Important:
Change the bussy loop in output handlet to cond. var.

Improve:
Extract the output queue (the flash indexes) to a standalone class. Think about the container...
memmove (instead of memcpy)
Add non-copyable to relevant classes
typedefs for LID, Index

Features:
function names: (__prety_function__)
line numbers in stackwalker. (No idea how to do this, in reasenable time...)
filter should be extracted, and put as policy
writer -> to template
